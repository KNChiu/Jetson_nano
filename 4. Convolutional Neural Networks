 # Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (卷积神经网络)
   Deep learning relies on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to transform images into predicted classifications.
   And is the preferred network for image applications.

 # Artificial Neural Network (人工神經網路)
   The network transforms input data by applying a nonlinear function to a weighted sum of the inputs.
   The intermediate outputs of one layer, called features, are used as the input into the next layer. 
   The neural network, through repeated transformations, learns multiple layers of nonlinear features (like edges and shapes), 
   which it then combines in a final layer to create a prediction (of more complex objects).
